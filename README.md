# ACORN task organization

This repository contains the code for the ACORN task organization. The code is written in Python 3.6. 
It uses the following packages: 
csv, plotly, pandas, and datetime.

The code is organized as follows:

- `data/`: contains the data files used in the analysis
- `figures/`: contains the figures generated by the analysis
- `main.py`: contains the Task class definition
- `Build_Task_List.py`: contains the functions used to import labor and M&S tasks from cvs files. The two CSV files currently used were takend from an excel spreadsheet initially used to enumerate the tasks.  If you run `Build_Task_List.py`, the `main()` function will be executed, which reads `data/ACORN_DAC_costing_Labor_costs.csv` and `data/ACORN_DAC_costing_MandS_costs.csv` See comments in code for more information on what each function does. The list of functions defined in `Build_Task_List.py` is: 
  - `find_task_index_by_name(name:str, tasks:list(Task))->int`
  - `find_task_by_name(name:str, tasks:list(Task))->Task`
  - `read_tasks(filename="data/ACORN_DAC_costing_Labor_costs.csv":str)->list(list(str))`
  - `read_labor_tasks(tasks=[]:list(Task), mapping={}:dict, filename="data/ACORN_DAC_costing_Labor_costs.csv":str)`
  - `read_acquisition_tasks(tasks=[]: list(Task), mapping={}:dict, filename="data/ACORN_DAC_costing_MandS_costs.csv":str)`
  - `export_tasks_to_csv(tasks=[]:List(Task))`
- `Analyze_cost.py`: imports tasks from the output of `Build_Task_List.py` and does simple costing calculations
- `Analyze_schedule.py`: imports tasks from the output of `Build_Task_List.py`, does simple scheduling calculations, and produces a Gantt chart.
